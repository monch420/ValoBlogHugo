An Expansion on our Commitment to Fandom and the Future of Esports
Today, we’re excited to announce the 2025 VCT Team Capsules, which build on the success of last year to offer you more ways to represent your favorite teams while directly contributing to their future. Team Capsules will allow fans to support their favorite teams directly, with a portion of proceeds going to the organizations throughout the season. 

Last year, you showed incredible support, helping us share over $44 million USD with our partnered teams from the Champions Collection and Team Skins. Your passion fuels this scene, and with the 2025 Capsules, we’re excited to build on last year’s team capsules with a new playcard with premium glow, new skin features, and new designs! 

Esports Digital Goods: What’s New?
Our goal with esports cosmetics remains the same: give players a way to show their pride in-game while financially supporting teams. In 2025, we’re building on last year’s momentum by introducing new digital offerings:

Returning Favorites: The Team Capsules and Champions Collection are back.
Season Capsule: A new collection featuring a unique melee skin, inspired by the success of the LOCK//IN collection in 2023. We’ll be sharing more information on this capsule later in the year.

Why the Classic?
The Classic is synonymous with VALORANT—it’s your trusty sidearm which is featured in every round of VALORANT, giving it extended time in the spotlight. Like a team jersey, it’s always in play, making it the perfect canvas for fans to showcase their loyalty. 

For 2025, the Team Capsules were designed with a “Midnight Splash” theme, in combination with a new set of branding from each of our partner teams, to create an “alternate jersey” to 2024. The goal here was to give a unique feel and identity to the Classics in 2025, and provide VCT teams with a platform to express their brand creativity in new ways.

What’s in the 2025 Capsules?

Here’s what you can expect in each Team Capsule:

Upgraded Classic Skin with team-themed design and new branding elements.
Achievement Tracker Inspect for teams with the accolades of major victories.
2025 Player Card with a premium finish, showcasing team identity and creativity.
Original 2024 Spray and Gun Buddy, with discounts for returning owners.
Classics representing teams who have won major events will feature special “winner’s flair,” like EDG for their victories at VCT CN and 2024 Champions!

The EDG player card will also feature Champion’s flair, unique to the 2024 World Champions! 

When Can You Grab Them?
The 2025 Team Capsules will be available throughout the season in the in-game Esports Store. Returning players will receive effective discounts for previously owned items, making it easier than ever to rep your fandom. Capsules for teams who earned promotion via Ascension, as well as Boom Esports, will be released later in the season. 

We’re hyped to see which teams you’ll be rooting for as we head into the next season of the VCT!
